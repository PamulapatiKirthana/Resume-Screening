The dataset focuses on collection of resumes obtained from various sources, such as job portals or online resume databases. The dataset is in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format which consists of 2 columns, representing information associated with a resume. 

The "Category" column indicates the job profile associated with the resume, such as software engineer or data analyst. The "Resume" column contains the actual text content of the resumes, which is important for using NLP techniques to analyze and process them.
